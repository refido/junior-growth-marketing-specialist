This is what most founders are doing

right now.

>> They're all building the same open AI

rappers and competing for demand.

But instead, this is what you should be

doing. Build niche AI solutions for

small but carefully targeted group of

people. When you say AI today, most of

you think about Cad GBT, Gemini, and

Clock. But in reality, there are

thousands, in fact millions of small,

super specialized AI models available to

use, and many of them are free and open

source. By fine-tuning, combining, and

chaining specific models, you can solve

many different niche problems for a

small group of users and turn it in to a

thriving business. Sounds complex? Well,

you need a bit of technical

understanding, but in reality, you can

put a SAS like this together using just

a few tools, and you can do it without

having to code. In this video, I'll show

you how to approach this step by step.

So, here's the problem I set out to

solve. My team and I produce a lot of

video content, but I can't stand generic

stock videos like the ones you find on

pixels. On the other hand, shooting

custom B-roll for every video is really

timeconuming. So, I wanted a SAS that

could create highquality AI generated

B-roll clips with me in it simply giving

a description in natural language. And

that's exactly what we're going to build

in this video. a small SAS tool where

you can upload images of yourself, use

it to create an AI character of

yourself, then use that character to

create AI generated B-roll clips. So,

this SAS is solving a problem I have

myself and I know a few other people who

have the same problem, but it's not a

big market and that's the whole point.

We're building a niche solution for a

small group of people here. I suggest

you do the same. Use the principles I'm

about to show you, but find a problem

you have and try to solve that for

yourself first. Let's get started. Let's

do a quick architectural breakdown. A

product like this will have three

layers. The first layer is a front end.

This is the part the user will be using.

We'll use lovable to vibe code this

part. The second layer is a back end.

This is where we'll store items in a

database such as characters and B-roll

clips. We'll use Superbase for this

part. Finally, the last layer is our AI

engine. We need a place to host and run

our AI models. We'll use replicate for

this part. So, let's get started with

the front end. Head over to lovable.dev

and we'll give it a very highlevel

prompt to begin with. No functionality

yet, just the UI.

And after running for a bit, it will set

up a new project for us. Awesome. We now

have the UI for uploading images and

creating a new character.

We also have some basic UI for

generating a clip and a basic history

page.

I think the design is pretty on point.

I'll take it. Now, as mentioned, we need

both a front end and a back end. And for

the back end, we're going to use

Superbase. And here's the great news.

Lovable now has a native superbase

integration, what they call Lovable

Cloud. So we can now handle both the

front end and the back end through

Lovable, which makes things a whole lot

easier. So let's just go ahead and click

connect Lovable Cloud.

Then enable cloud here

and then allow Lovable to set it all up.

And now if we click the cloud button up

here, we'll see that we have all these

things available in our project. These

are all the things that make up our back

end. Awesome. So far so good. Now, the

way this SAS works is by uploading a

bunch of images in a zip file in order

to create a character. Now that we have

the backend set up, let's have Lovable

create this functionality for us.

We're going to give it this prompt.

[Music]

And here we'll see Lovable ask for

permission to update some stuff on the

cloud including a database table and

storage.

We'll allow this and all of our backend

stuff will be set up.

Lovable and Superbase comes with user

authentication built in and it's very

easy to set up. So you can do that now

if you want to or for building the PC

you can simply tell Lovable to just

assume a mock user for now. That's what

I'll do. Perfect. Now, after a bit of

working, we should have a form that we

can use to create a character

and upload a SIP.

Okay, seems to work. Let's just verify.

If you go to the cloud section here,

then go to storage, and then there

should be a folder for our mock user.

And there we go. The zip was uploaded.

Perfect.

Now, this is probably a good time to

make a quick note that with these types

of AI coding tools, things don't always

go as smoothly as they just did here. In

many cases, something won't work, and

you'll be going back and forth with

Lovable for a bit until things play

nicely. But it's totally normal and not

very different from how things would

flow if you were working with a team of

human developers. So, just keep in mind

that this is an iterative process and

some patience is required. Now, let's

move on to the fun part. We need to set

up the chain of AI models we'll use for

this SAS. Let's get an overview. When a

new character is created, we want to

trigger a training job. This will use

the uploaded images to create a custom

image generation model that can generate

new images with the character in them.

This process is called fine-tuning.

Then, when a new B-roll clip is created,

we chain two models. The custom image

generation model will generate an image.

The image is then fed to a video

generation model and used as the

starting frame for the clip.

We will do this on replicate. So head

over to replicate.com and create a new

account. Here we'll use the fastflux

trainer model to fine-tune our custom

image generation model. And we'll use

clingv 2.1 to turn an image into a

video. And I know all this might sound

complex, but don't worry cuz lovable

already knows how to use the replicate

library and intuitively does a great job

in wiring this together. And I'll show

you how. in our replicate dashboard.

Let's go get the API key.

And back in the cloud section of

Lovable, let's go to secrets and add

that API key here.

We're also going to take the replicate

username, which is the one you'll see up

here,

and give that to lovable under secrets,

too.

Good. Let's ask Lovable to use the

replicate API to start training our

model. This is the prompt we'll give it.

And as you can see, we're given Lovable

a few technical details here.

And again, Lovable will probably ask you

to allow it to create some database

tables and update security policies and

so on. Just let it do its thing and it

will set up everything for you. And if

you don't know any technical stuff like

this, don't worry. With Lovable, you'll

get there eventually. It would just take

longer and require more patience. So,

giving these AI coding tools some

technical descriptions really does help

a lot. So, try to do that if and

whenever you can. Awesome. Now hopefully

maybe with a bit of back and forth

you'll have something like this. So we

can now create a character

and it will start training that

character on your images

and replicate under the trainings tab.

We should now see our flux trainer

running.

After a few minutes, the character will

finish and the UI will update like this.

Awesome. And in Replicate, we can verify

this by clicking over to the models tab.

Here we should see our new custom model.

Perfect. The first part of our SAS is

now working. Now, if we go to the

generate B-roll page, we currently have

a form that looks nice but does nothing.

This is the next part we need to tell

Lovable to implement. So, first we want

to get the configuration for the image

model. And the easiest way to do this is

to simply test it out on replicate

first. So we're going to add our test

prompt here.

We'll use a 169 aspect ratio.

And since we want a bit higher quality

images, let's increase this to around

40.

PNG

full output quality. And let's run it.

All right, there we go. Looks good to

me. So, let's click over here and we can

simply copy all these configurations.

Perfect. Now, let's use this and give

Lovable a big prompt here. We'll give it

the configurations here. And again, it's

good to remind Lovable how replicates

API works so it can implement a proper

polling mechanism.

All right. Again, you might have to do a

little back and forth with Lovable if

this step doesn't work from the get- go,

but you should get to a flow that works

something like this.

We choose the character from the list.

We give it a prompt.

We can give it a style, though, I don't

actually think this does anything yet.

And finally, let's run it.

And there we go. Perfect B-roll clip of

our character, which is me in this case

walking in an office. Awesome, man. Just

super cool. And if we go to replicate

and click the predictions tab, we should

be able to see these two predictions

from the API. The one from the custom

image and then the one from cling.

Looks like it's working perfectly. And

one thing I absolutely love about

lovable is how good it is at filling in

the gaps. We have toast messages,

spinners, various disabled and loading

states, progress bars, and so on and so

on. I didn't ask for any of that.

Lovable simply figured that we probably

would want that. Before AI, we'd have to

manually sit and code all of that stuff,

and it would take forever. And if we

would use a development agency, we would

have to explicitly ask for all of that,

which for a lot of non techch founders

just isn't something they think about.

So they'd get this super halfbaked

product back because that's what they

ask for. Lovable does this extremely

well and I think it's such a cool

experience. Finally, let's create the

history page. This one should be very

straightforward since everything is set

up now.

And finally, you'll have a history page

like this where you can see all your

previous clips.

And if we go to the cloud section in

Lovable, we'll see that we now have a

database with two tables in it.

We have a storage bucket for the zip

files and we have a bunch of these cloud

functions. This is basically backend

code. Lovable created all of this for us

and we didn't have to touch any code at

any point. Now, we also notice that we

get this warning. This is because we

didn't implement user authentication

earlier. So, if I publish this app,

everyone could create B-roll clips using

my replicate account, which is obviously

a huge issue. So when you see this

warning, you should make sure to resolve

all security issues before publishing

your app. And obviously, it doesn't

necessarily need to stop here. In

between these two models, we could have

added GPT5 to automatically enhance the

prompts before feeding it into the

replicate models. And we could have

added an upscaling step at the end to

get full 4K quality using a video

upscaler model and just about a hundred

other things. Replicate already has

models for a ton of different things.

But if you really want to go niche and

it's not already on Replicate, you can

go to hawking phase and find an

additional 2 million super specialized

AI models, fine-tune them, and upload

them to your replicate account.

Everything that can be solved with AI is

available here. And as I've mentioned a

few times now, in this video, I've shown

the cut down happy path of building a

tool like this. In the real world, it's

unlikely to go this smooth in the first

try. And typically you'll have to go

back and forth with lovable for a bit.

So don't get discouraged if it doesn't

spin up a SAS for you exactly how you

want it in the first try. And if you

want to take a SAS like this to the next

level, you should layer the approach

we've discussed in this video with two

additional layers of AI assisted coding

which I cover in this video. So go watch

this one next.
