I'm convinced that cloud providers are

designed exactly like casinos. The

architecture, the UI, and specifically

the pricing models. They're all

engineered to make you lose track of how

much you're actually spending. It's

never one big purchase. It's a fraction

of a cent here, a tiny data transfer fee

there, and before you know it, you are

bleeding thousands of dollars a year on

resources you don't even use. I spent

the last week auditing my own

infrastructure and I found six specific

traps. These are sneaky default settings

and misleading pricing structures that

providers like AWS and Versel use to

inflate your bill without you noticing.

Today, I'm going to show you exactly

what they are and how to fix them. The

first trap happens on AWS. I call this

the Cloudatch buildup trap. Here's what

happens. You spin up a new resource. It

could be a Lambda function, an RDS

instance, or maybe a new ECS cluster.

Automatically, AWS creates a Cloudatch

lock group associated with it. Now,

here's what many people don't realize.

The default retention policy for that

new lock group is always set to never

expire. And AWS is billing you for logs

in two ways. You pay to ingest the data,

but you also pay a monthly fee for every

gigabyte stored. And because the default

retention policy is set to never expire,

that storage cost accumulates forever.

You're literally paying monthly rent for

gigabytes of old text logs from Lambda

calls that happened years ago. And over

time, this actually becomes pretty

significant. So if you like using

Cloudatch to search through your logs,

the easiest way to fix this is to simply

change the retention period to something

like 5 or 7 days, whatever works for

you.

But if you're anything like me and you

think Cloudatch is a terrible user and

developer experience, there's an even

sneaker and much more aggressive way to

fight this. Set up Grafana on a cheap

self-hosted server or VPS. Create a

Cloudatch data source in Grafana and

configure this to pull your log groups

at an interval, for instance, every 30

seconds.

This will move all of your logs to your

own server which you can host for a

fraction of the cost and make all the

logs available through Graphana which in

my opinion is a much better experience.

Now go back to Cloudatch on AWS and set

the retention to one day.

There you go. You made your life more

pleasant and you're saving a bunch of

money at the same time. And if you want

to double down, set up a cron job in

GitHub actions to occasionally run

through all regions, find all log

groups, and update the retention period

on all of them, just in case you created

a new resource and forgot to do this

manually. The second trap is what I call

the bandwidth trap. We all want our

landing pages to look slick. So, you

decide to add a highquality looping

background video in the hero section or

a promo video to showcase your tool. The

file is only 10 megabytes, so you

committed to a repo and push to

production. No big deal, right? Well,

this is where data egress fees come in

to kill your margins. Let's do the math.

If just 1,000 people visit your site,

that little 10 megabyte file turns into

10 GB of data transfer. If you go viral

and get a 100,000 visitors, that is a

terabyte of data. Now, if you're hosting

on a platform like Versel, their pro

plan gives you 1 terbte included. But

the moment you cross that line, they

charge you $0.15 for every extra

gigabyte. That bill scales up pretty

fast and it's just a terrible way to

burn cash. The quick fix here is to

upload that video to YouTube or Vimeo

and just embed their player. I'm doing

that on one of my websites. It works

pretty well and you're essentially

letting Google pay your bandwidth bill.

Though, if you want that clean native

HTML video element, here's a better way

to do it. host your heavy assets on

Cloudflare R2. Unlike S3 on AWS or other

big providers, Cloudflare R2 charges you

exactly $0 for egress bandwidth. You

only pay a tiny amount for the storage

itself. So in this way, you can get the

performance of a global CDN, the clean

look of a native video tag, and you

completely bypass the bandwidth trap,

which leads me to the third trap, what I

call the optimization trap. If you're

using Nex.js, XJS, you probably use

their magic image component. You know,

the one that automatically resizes and

compresses photos for every device size.

But here's the thing. Platforms like

Bracel charge you for those image

optimizations. And their limits are

actually pretty low, something like

a,000 transformations. If you run a

directory site or website with a lot of

images, you will blow through that quota

in days and suddenly you are paying

premium prices just to show pictures.

Now, I know the standard advice is to

configure a custom loader or tweak the

settings, but honestly, my fix is

simple. Stop using the image component

and just use the standard HTML image

tag. Instead of relying on the server to

resize images on the fly, simply save

your images as WEBP files at a

reasonable oneizefits-all resolution.

This serves a high quality image that

looks great on both desktop and mobile,

and it doesn't touch Versel's processing

limits at all. Now, I know lighthouse

score, web vitals, blah blah. The

obsession with microoptimizing load

speeds has been completely blown out of

proportion. We're now living in the

world of 5G and fiber internet. The

difference in load time between a

perfectly optimized responsive image and

a standard WEBP file is probably

unnoticeable to your users. And Google's

penalty for unoptimized images is

completely blown out of proportion to.

I'm firmly convinced that highquality

content outweighs a fraction of a second

in load time. So write a simple script

that uses Shark to batch convert your

entire media folder to WEBP during build

time. You get 90% of the optimization

benefits, but with 0% of the recurring

cost or vendor lock. The fourth trap is

what I call the region premium trap.

This isn't a super common one, but it

does happen. And most cloud providers

like AWS, you pick a region. And

naturally, most people just pick the

city that is physically closest to where

they live. If you're in the UK, you pick

London. If you're in Brazil, you pick S.

Paulo. If you're in South Africa, you

pick Cape Town. But here's the mistake.

Cloud pricing is not global. It's local.

Because of higher taxes, electricity

cost, and infrastructure challenges,

servers in places like S. Paulo or Cape

Town can be up to 50% more expensive

than the exact same servers in the US.

So unless you have strict legal

requirements that force you to keep data

within your country's borders or you're

building a tool where every millisecond

counts, just pick US- East. I literally

pick US- East one for almost all of my

products. This is almost always the

cheapest region available. For 99% of

SAS applications, the latency difference

is negligible, but the savings on your

monthly bill can be quite significant.

If you're in the EU and you want your

data processing agreement to say that

your data centers are in the EU, you may

want to pick one of the EU regions,

though. But as far as I know, AWS

actually can't guarantee that data

strictly stays in that region anyway.

So, not sure if it solves anything

really. The next trap is what I call the

NoSQL hype trap. There's this massive

narrative in the tech world that you

need to be serverless and use databases

like DynamoB. And honestly, I thought so

too for a long long time. I thought it

was super convenient that I didn't have

to worry about how my databases were

hosted. They were just there, always

available and with backups running

automatically. But the downside is

Dynamob and other serverless databases

charge you per operation. So every time

you read, every time you write, every

time you query or scan, you're charged.

And this is only financially viable if

your data structure is perfectly

optimized for specific access patterns.

And you often have to use complex

strategies like single table design to

make that math work. And the reality for

us founders is that we don't know what's

going to happen tomorrow. We pivot. We

add new features. We change how we want

to display data. At the moment your

query needs change, your perfectly

optimized NoSQL database kind of loses

its purpose. You end up running

inefficient scans and queries and it

just end up costing a lot of money. At

some point, you may even feel inclined

to avoid certain features or to

sacrifice good user experience just to

avoid making too many reads or writes.

The fix is simple. Stick to boring

technology. Use Postgress or MySQL. SQL

is much more forgiving. You can pivot

your products, add new features, and

query your data in ways you didn't plan

for without having to worry about how it

affect costs. And best of all, you pay a

flat monthly fee for the server box. It

doesn't matter if your queries are messy

or complex. The price is the same. The

final trap is what I call the zombie

resource trap. This one is extremely

common because of how cloud providers

decouple their services. For instance,

they treat the computer, the hard drive,

and the load balancer as three

completely separate products. So, here's

the trap. You decide to shut down your

project to save money. You go into the

console and delete the server instance,

and you think you're done, but you're

not. Often, the load balancer does not

get deleted with the server. It stays

behind because it's no longer attached

to anything. doesn't show up on your

main dashboard, but you're still paying

about $18 a month for a zombie load

balancer that is routing traffic to

absolutely nowhere. To fix this, you

need to stop clicking around through

random tabs to find things. Go to the

search bar and type tag editor. It is

inside the AWS resource groups. In the

settings, set regions to all regions.

Set resource types to all supported

resource types and hit search.

This gives you a full list of every

single item currently alive in your

account. Scroll through that list. If

you see a load balancer or hard drive

volume or any other resource for a

project you thought you deleted, kill it

immediately. If you're setting up a

whole bunch of resources, I can highly

recommend using an infrastructure as

code tool like AWS CDK. This makes it

much easier to keep things organized,

and it saves you from a lot of clicking

around the UI, and it's much easier to

clean up all the resources and

dependencies using a single command. If

you've been watching my videos for a

while, you probably noticed that I

changed things up a bit here in my last

few videos. I simplified my studio and

relaxed the editing a bit, but I also

changed the software I'm using. I used

to do all of my videos using Adobe

Premiere and Adobe After Effects, but I

recently changed to Da Vinci Resolve.

And honestly, I'm blown away by the

quality of this software that I always

saw as a bit of an underdog. So, instead

of paying an expensive monthly fee to

Adobe, which, let's face it, are known

for using some pretty aggressive and

predatory practices, I made a one-time

purchase and got this new software, Da

Vinci Resolve, which is arguably a much

better tool. And I'm honestly kind of

embarrassed that it took me so long. And

it got me thinking generally, not just

specific to cloud providers or editing

tools, I think we should try looking for

the underdog a bit more often cuz I

really think it's insane how much value

we can get for much less just by not

defaulting to these huge established

companies. And in all honesty, it's how

I try to position myself as well with my

tools. That's also why on my main

website, I put my tools right next to

these big established tools. So, it's

super clear what my tools are aiming to

replace and how much more affordable

they are. And I'm biased, of course, but

I honestly believe that the tools my

team and I built are simply much higher

quality products. And we do have a lot

of testimonials confirming that, too.

This isn't a political channel, so I'm

not going to get deep into this, but I

personally think that we got a bit lazy

and that we're slowly allowing a small

handful of mega corporations to

basically build monopoly. And one small

thing we could do is instead of just

defaulting to these three big companies

we already heard of when we have a new

problem, maybe spend just a little time

scratching a little deeper and see if

you can find a lesserk known

alternative. In this way, we can spread

out where revenue goes a bit more and in

most cases actually end up with a much

better solution to whatever problem we

had. So, just a small encouragement from

here to try to support the underdog a

bit more often. So, here's my challenge

to you. Don't just click away from this

video. Open your AWS console or your

Versell dashboard right now. Audit those

logs. Check those regions. Kill those

zombie resources. And if you go through

this list and realize that the cloud has

become too much of a headache, well,

maybe it's time to pack your bags. I

recently published a full breakdown of

why I left the cloud entirely and moved

to self-hosted servers. You can watch

that one right here.
