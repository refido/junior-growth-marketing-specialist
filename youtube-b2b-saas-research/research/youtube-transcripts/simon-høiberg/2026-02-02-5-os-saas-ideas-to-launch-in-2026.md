There's a new movement happening in SAS

and it's not AI. Founders are waking up.

We're realizing that the convenience of

big tech has come at the cost of our

margins and our control. So, we're

seeing a massive migration from the

cloud back to bare metal infrastructure

and open-source software. [music] So,

instead of fighting over users in the AI

space, there is now a big opportunity to

capitalize on this movement. And in this

video, I want to cover five SAS ideas in

this space. I believe could be huge.

If you're new to this channel, welcome

here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a SAS

portfolio of five SAS tools. And if

you're wondering why I'm here handing

out SAS ideas for free instead of just

building them myself, it's because I am.

My SAS portfolio founder stack contains

five SAS tools already. And because I

work with SAS every single day, I get a

ton of ideas I believe could have

amazing potential. But obviously, I

cannot build them all. So instead of

keeping them to myself, I'd much rather

talk about them here. So maybe you can

take one of these ideas and [music] run

with it. So without further ado, let's

get to it. The first idea is an

open-source affiliate marketing tool.

Now, this one actually comes from a very

real personal pain point. We recently

launched the partner program for Founder

Stack. And naturally, we needed a tool

to handle affiliate links, tracking, and

payouts. So, I tried a bunch of the most

well-known tools on the market. And

don't get me wrong, they're great tools,

but they all had one major requirement

that had me think again. [music] In

order for these tools to work, you have

to connect them to your Stripe account.

You have to give them read access to

your revenue, your customer emails, and

your transaction history. [music] And

honestly, I just wasn't comfortable with

that. sharing that level of sensitive

financial data with a third party tool

just to track some clicks just didn't

feel right. So instead, we decided to

vibe code our own solution. It took us

about a week and we now have a fully

custom partner platform running on our

own infrastructure. But it got me

realizing something. If there had been a

solid open-source affiliate tool that I

could have self-hosted on my own server,

I would have picked that in a heartbeat.

And I think this is a massive

opportunity for 2026. [music]

First of all, it solves the privacy

issue. You keep your Stripe keys and

your customer data on your own database.

No third party ever gets access to any

of your sensitive data. And secondly, it

solves transparency. A huge [music]

issue with affiliate programs is trust.

Are partners actually getting the

payouts they've earned? And is the

attribution logic fair? With an open

source platform, this code would be

public. [music] Your partners can

inspect the logic and confirm that you

are being honest with sales attribution.

[music] That builds a level of trust

that a blackbox says simply can't match.

[music] Now, if I were to build this as

a business today, I would structure the

monetization in three [music] layers.

One, a free community edition, fully

open source. Anyone can fork it and host

it. [music] This gets you distribution

and makes it the standard. Two, a pro

lifetime [music] license. you sell a

supporter edition that comes with

advanced features, maybe multi- teamam

support or advanced analytics for a

onetime fee. And [music] three, and this

is the big one, a full done for you

service. This would be the equivalent of

a merchant of record, but specifically

[music]

for affiliate payouts. You offer service

where you handle the tax compliance and

the actual money transfer to the

affiliates while a software runs on

their server. I really think the market

is begging for a solution like this. The

second idea is an agentic QA tester.

So, not long ago, I saw this tweet and

it sparked [music] quite a bit of

debate. But I'll be completely honest

with you, I don't look at all the code

the AI is generating anymore either.

[music] In fact, I stopped asking the AI

to refactor or optimize for human

readability because I figured it's most

likely an AI that will be reading and

maintaining that code in the future

anyway. Instead, I simply do manual QA

on the solution that the AI built to see

if everything still works. Though, I've

noticed one thing. Having an AI go over

another AI's work, sometimes even

multiple times, drastically increases

the quality of the code. So, why

wouldn't this principle apply to the QA

part, too? Imagine a tool where instead

of writing all these comprehensive

Cyprus or Playright tests that break

[music] every time you change a tiny

little thing, you just give the AI a

mission. Go to the pricing page, select

the pro plan, and make sure the checkout

flow works. This agent would spin up a

headless browser, look at the screen

using computer vision, [music] and click

through the application exactly like a

human would. It solves the biggest

[music] pain in testing, which is

maintenance. You get the reliability of

end-to-end testing without the nightmare

of constantly keeping your testing logic

up to date. Now, how do you monetize

this? Well, this is the perfect

candidate for a usage-based [music]

pricing model. You are selling a junior

QA engineer. So, you charge per test run

or per agent minute or maybe just AI

credits and then let the user top up.

You could also offer a higher tier

enterprise plan where the agent runs

inside their own VPC. So unreleased

products never touch your cloud. This is

a massive compliance requirement for big

tech and some companies will pay a

premium for that privacy. Idea number

three is what I call a shadow database

tool. We all use these amazing no code

tools to run our businesses. We use

tools for our project management, for

our CRM, and for our internal vickies.

And the user experiences of these

commercial products like Notion and Air

Table are incredible. They are miles

ahead of most open- source alternatives

and certainly way ahead of anything we

could ever build ourselves. But they all

come with one massive downside. They own

your data. If one of these platforms

decide to double their pricing or if

they decide to change their terms or

worst case, if they decide to ban your

[music] account, you are completely

locked out. your business data is

trapped inside their proprietary data

stores. [music] This is the classic

vendor lock trap. So the idea here is to

build a data liberation engine. Think of

it as a sync tool [music] that connects

to the APIs of these SAS platforms and

pulls your data in real time into a

standard [music]

raw Postgress database that you host on

your server. Now you can still use the

SAS product exactly as you do today.

You're not replacing it, but you are

creating a live readonly mirror of every

single piece of data you create. It's

effectively a data insurance against

vendor lock. If the SAS provider ever

becomes a problem or if they shut down,

you don't just have a messy export dump.

You have a structured SQL database with

all your customers tasks and notes ready

to be plugged into a new tool.

This product would then have a bunch of

different connectors to other popular

platforms. So [music] if you were to

move from notion to Monday, you would

simply click a button and this tool

would normalize your data from notion

and then import it into Monday

automatically. In terms of monetization,

I would follow the open core model here.

The core sync engine is free and open

source. This gets you the trust of the

developer community because they [music]

can inspect the code and see that you

aren't stealing anyone's data. But then

you monetize on the connectors. Maybe

the connectors for tools like notion or

air table is free, but the connectors to

Salesforce, SAP [music] or Oracle, the

enterprise connectors requires a paid

license. And of course, you can offer a

managed cloud version where you host the

shadow database for them for a monthly

subscription. That's a very proven, very

scalable business model. SAS idea number

four is a self-hosted AI media studio.

Right now, if you want to generate

highquality AI images or videos, you

generally have two options. You can go

to platforms like Midjourney or Runway.

These are completely closed ecosystems

running their own proprietary models. Or

you can use aggregators like Open Art.

Now, Open Art is great because it lets

you use and combine different models in

one place. But their business model is

based on credits. Essentially, they are

reselling you the compute, but with a

markup. You pay a subscription, you get

a balance, and when it runs out, you pay

again. But if we look [music] at the

textbased AI world, we have this

incredible tool called typing mic. If

you haven't seen it, it's a beautiful UI

that let you chat with GBT5, cla or

Gemini. But instead of paying a monthly

subscription for credits, you simply buy

a one-time license for the software and

then you plug in your own API key.

[music]

This means you are paying wholesale

prices for the AI inference directly to

the provider. No markup, no middleman.

[music]

We need this exact same model, but for

AI video and images. The idea is to

build a self-hostable UI that sits on

top of AI pass providers like Replicate

or Fell AI. It would be a studio tool

that let you chain together the most

popular models like [music] Flux or Nano

Banana for images or cling or Pixieverse

or Sora for video. You wouldn't be

selling credits. You wouldn't be selling

compute. You are simply selling the

interface. The user brings their own API

key from replicate. They pay replicate

directly for the generation. You just

provide an awesome UI workflow builder

to combine these models. And in terms of

monetization, this is a perfect [music]

candidate for the lifetime license

model. Just like typing mine, you sell

the software for a onetime fee. For

instance, $79 or $99. Since you don't

have any server cost because the user

connects directly to the AI provider,

your recurring cost is effectively zero.

It's pure software play. You build it

once, you update it occasionally, and

you sell the license forever. This is

exactly the kind of low overhead, high

margin business that is perfect for a

solo founder in 2026. The last idea is

unfortunately a bit more serious. One of

my favorite YouTubers, Pat Walls from

Starter Story, recently had a terrible

experience with YouTube. Out of nowhere,

his content started getting flagged

[music] as dangerous. And he started

receiving strikes on his channel. And as

you know, after three strikes, YouTube

doesn't just suspend you, they may

delete your entire channel. Years of

work gone overnight. He talked about

this on Twitter. And as it turns out, it

wasn't just him. This started happening

to a bunch of business YouTubers

seemingly due to some AI moderation

error. Now, fortunately, I haven't

experienced any of this myself, but

seeing that happen to the starter story

channel made me incredibly

uncomfortable, and it is a harsh

reminder that we cannot really rely on

big tech for our businesses. We are

building our houses on rented land. So,

the idea is to build a self-hostable

YouTube clone. I'm talking about a

platform you can spin up on your own

server that functions exactly like

[music] YouTube. It handles the video

hosting, the streaming, the quality

adjustments, and it has a full UI for

likes, [music] comments, and related

video suggestions, and so on. Now, to be

clear, this obviously cannot replace

YouTube as a platform and the network.

But it's a place where your viewers can

go and watch your content if the

unthinkable happens. [music]

Place where you own the platform, you

own the database of comments, and you

own the subscribe button. In terms of

monetization, this is the perfect

creator economy tool. You could release

the community edition for free, which

just handles video hosting, perfect for

personal archives or small channels, but

then you could monetize by selling

membership features as a paid license.

This would allow creators to turn their

self-hosted platform into their own

version of Patreon or YouTube Premium.

They can put their videos behind a payw

wall, [music] connect their own Stripe

account, and keep 100% of the revenue

from their biggest fans. In 2026,

creators are waking up to the platform

risk. [music]

Selling them the ultimate backup plan

is, in my opinion, a very powerful value

proposition. [music]

Now, as you know, these are just ideas.

They are completely worthless if you

don't execute. And if you feel the

analysis paralysis kicking in already,

let me [music] help you out. Cuz in this

video, I'm showing you how to build a

niche AI SAS with lovable and replicate

step by step. So take one of these

ideas, go watch this video next, and

then go build yourself a SAS.
